# Abstract

One major pain point of building RAG applications is that it requires a lot of experimentation and tuning, and there are hardly any good benchmarks to evaluate the accuracy of the retrieval step only.

The preprocessing step of the RAG pipeline is particularly painful and hard to evaluate. The chunking step is crucial and determines how the information is going to be retrieved, but there are no benchmarks to evaluate which chunking strategy works best. For example, there is no good way of answering the following question:

“Which chunking strategy leads to the highest faithfulness of the retrieval while also maximizing the signal to ratio of the retrieved chunks?”

In this work, we have evaluated different chunking strategies on the LegalBenchConsumerContractsQA dataset.

Here are our main contributions:  

- We created a modified LegalBenchConsumerContractsQA dataset, where the answer consists of a list of sentence-level chunks found in the corpus. This dataset will be our ground truth when looking at the signal to noise metric.
- We tested 3 main chunking strategies, each with a variety of hyperparameters:
  - NaiveChunk: fixed size chunks of varying length with varying overlap ratio
  - SemanticChunk: embedding similarity based chunks with varying threshold parameter
  - zChunk Algorithm: prompt-based chunks created by Llama-70B
- For the zChunk Algorithm, we output the logprobs to chunk at a certain level of the document.
- Finally, we create a hyperparameter tuning pipeline for the NaiveChunk method to tune the chunk size and overlap parameters. We will release the code and allow anyone to tune these parameters for their use case and benchmarks

# RAG with Llama

Here we present a novel method of processing files for use in RAG applications.

In order to implement a RAG pipeline, the first step is always to split the document into small chunks, and embed each chunk into a vector database for retrieval. However, the issue is that splitting a document into chunks is difficult. If you simply split every 100 characters, you break up the meaning. For example, when chunking this snippet of the U.S. Constitution,

```
Section. 1.
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.

Section. 2.
The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.

No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.
```

=>

### Chunk 1

```
Section. 1.
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.

Section. 2.
The House of Representa
```

### Chunk 2

```

```

### Chunk 3

```
s Branch of the State Legislature.

No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall
```

These chunks completely destroy the ability to understand the content of the document. The current SoTA is to write a regex to split by line or sentence, and then group sentences using embedding similarity. This is called "semantic" chunking. However, regex involves need to do custom additional work for every new document type you want to support, and when it breaks the results are poor.

Here, we present zChunk:

## zChunk algorithm

The zChunk algorithm is simple: We pick a special token that we know is not in the corpus, e.g. "段".
- We pick the character "段" because 1. tiktoken always encodes it to exactly one token, 2. it is not in the corpus, and 3. it means "section" in Chinese.

Then, we ask Llama to repeat the User's message with the "段" token sprinkled throughout.

SYSTEM_PROMPT (paraphrased for brevity):
```
Your job is to act as a chunker.

You should insert the "段" throughout the input.

Your goal is to separate the content into semantically relevant groupings.
```

Output:

```
Section. 1.
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,
which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.段

Section. 2.
The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States,
and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for
Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.段

No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years,
and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected,
be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.段
```

And just like that, it's perfect out of the box! It correctly used the "段" character to mark the end of every section. We just need to do `chunks = ai_response.split("段")` to get our chunks. Each section is now RAG-ready.

### zChunk optimization

If you've ever worked with LLM's, you know that input tokens are processed almost instantly, and output tokens take an eternity to generate. A naïve method is to simply wait for the LLM to repeat the entire python code, inserting "段" throughout.

However, by inferencing llama locally, we have a vastly more efficient way of doing this! We can simply pass in the entire paragraph, and check the logprobs to see the probability that Llama wanted to output a "段" token at that location!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55f4fbd8-890e-4547-b365-cc98cfbc7500)

Done! The high logprob values (Seen in red), clearly indicate the locations that we should chunk! And, this is only possible because we have direct low-level access to Llama 3.1 70B.

---

Of course, there is a caveat. Because there are no output tokens, Llama can no longer see its own line breaks. Thus, as the text gets longer, it loses the willpower to continue to want to output "段"

But, we can simply normalize by this decaying curve in order to to fix this:

And now, we're ready to split any type of document, without having to resort to regex or manually created rules:

## Benchmarks

Processing 450,000 characters took about 15 minutes on an A100. However, ~80% of that time was saving and loading the KVCache (Which can be done instantly if written in C++, rather than Python). So, we can expect that it would take 3 minutes per 450,000 characters if done optimally. Or, 7 MTokens per hour.

Our quality benchmarks against a LegalBenchConsumerContractsQA are as follows:

![](https://i.imgur.com/g9RJIz0.png)

As you can see, zChunk has a higher retrieval ratio score, _and_ a higher signal ratio score, than the naïve method and the SoTA method of semantic chunking (Which uses embeddings to detect sentence split boundaries, and still requires a good regex-based sentence splitter).

## Details

One thing you might wonder: What if the ideal chunk split is not along a token boundary? E.g.,

![](https://i.imgur.com/7brctyQ.png)

Well for one thing, this is rare, as tokenizers intentionally split along meaningful boundaries. However, if the best split really is after the "f" in "fun", then you calculate

```python
lp = logprob(prefix="Fine Tuning is", next_token=" f")
if lp > -7:
    lp *= logprob(prefix="Fine Tuning is f", next_token="段")
```

In other words, if the logprob of token " f" has a non-negligible value > -7, then we can multiply by the logprob of the token after that being "段". The first line of code has a prefix that matches the main inference, so it does not need to be recalculated. However, if the "if" statement passes, then we'll have to do an extra inference, costing us latency. However, this "if" statement almost never passes (In our measurement, it happens once every ~2000 tokens, so it amortizes well).
